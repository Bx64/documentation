nOS provides a mechanism for registering a dapp at a `.neo` "domain" (e.g.: `nos.neo`), which can
then be viewed through the nOS client.  By registering a domain with the nOS Smart Contract, you can
build a simple web app that can interact with a set of simple API functions exposed by the nOS
client.  These API functions provide a simple mechanism for performing actions on behalf of the
account if the user chooses to provide access.
